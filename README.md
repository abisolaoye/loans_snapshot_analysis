## Environment & Setup
To ensure a robust local environment, I implemented the following:
* **Server**: SQL Express Server with Management Studio (SSMS).
* **Data Ingestion**: Imported raw Excel datasets into relational tables.
* **Data Integrity**: Performed manual schema validation and data type correction to ensure query accuracy.
